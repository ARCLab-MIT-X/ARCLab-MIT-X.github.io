# Space Robotics Research

We focus on three main areas of research: **Manipulators**, **Software**, and **GNC**.  

---

## Manipulators

### Hardware
- Building and maintaining functioning robotic arms and hands  
- Setting up robotic systems (e.g., mounting bimanual manipulator)  
- Improving **LEAP hand dexterity** by modifying the controller  
  - Explore the full range of control achievable with VR  
- Setup space experiment testbeds  
  - Docking scenario on the air bearing table  
  - Using robotic arms to simulate spacecraft trajectories

## Software

### Robotics & Systems
- Scripting controllers for robots  
  - Writing functions that move motors or read from motors  
- Contributing, documenting, and maintaining the **BEAVR** codebase  
- Researching and improving our network design  

### Developer Tools & Infrastructure
- Creating tutorials for how to integrate a new robot or use the repository  
- Re-designing the **LeRobot interface**  
  - Maintain a wrapper that allows using the LeRobot repo without forking  
  - e.g., create a LeRobot API or use LeRobot as a submodule  
- Creating a comprehensive testing suite  
- Containerizing the application  
- Supporting and improving simulation environments  

### Applications
- Improving the VR app  
- Supporting and demonstrating new control inputs (e.g., remote control)  
- Contributing to **physical AI research**  

### AI & Learning
- Designing new models for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL), and generalist policies (e.g., SmolVLA, pi0)  
- Exploring multi-modal fusion (e.g., LiDAR, touch, etc.)  
- Investigating reasoning models such as **GR00T**
