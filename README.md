# Space Robotics Research

We focus on three main areas of research: **Manipulators**, **Software**, and **GNC**.  

---

## Manipulators

### Hardware
- Building and maintaining functioning robotic arms and hands  
- Setting up robotic systems (e.g., mounting bimanual manipulator)  
- Improving **LEAP hand dexterity** by modifying the controller  
  - Explore the full range of control achievable with VR  
- Setup space experiment testbeds  
  - Docking scenario on the air bearing table  
  - Using robotic arms to simulate spacecraft trajectories

## Software

### Robotics & Systems
- Scripting controllers for robots  
  - Writing functions that move motors or read from motors  
- Contributing, documenting, and maintaining the [**BEAVR**](https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/beavr-bot) codebase  
- Researching and improving our network design  

### Developer Tools & Infrastructure
- Creating tutorials for how to integrate a new robot or use the repository  
- Re-designing the **LeRobot interface**  
  - Maintain a wrapper that allows using the [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) repo without forking  
  - e.g., create a [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) API or use LeRobot as a submodule  
- Creating a comprehensive testing suite
- Containerizing the application using docker
- Supporting and improving simulation environments

### Applications
- Improving the [VR app](https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/BeaVR-app/tree/6aef2fbf7e1532d0715fb41ef5e0bd2e13194acf)
- Supporting and demonstrating new control inputs (e.g., remote control)  
- Contributing to **physical AI research**

### AI & Learning
- Designing and researching new models for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL), and generalist policies (e.g., SmolVLA, pi0)  
- Exploring multi-modal fusion (e.g., LiDAR, touch, etc.)  
- Investigating reasoning models such as **GR00T**
